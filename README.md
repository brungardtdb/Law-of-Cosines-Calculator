# Law-of-Cosines-Calculator
A C# console application that prompts the user to enter the two known sides of an oblique triangle, as well as the angle opposite to the side they are trying to find. The application then converts the angle to radians ((degrees * Math.PI) / 180), then uses the Math.Cos() function to find the cosine of the angle from the radians. After that, the application uses the law of cosines to determine the missing side (C = sqrt(a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 - 2abcosC)) and reads the length of the missing side back to the user. I've included some exception handling, haven't quite figured out how to keep the program running after an incorrect value was entered, but at least it will give you an error message before closing.
